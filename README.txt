All of the files and code for my sensor network including databases
HTML Works on FLASK inheritance  
The partner program written in Java is in one of my github repos however it no longer works on Linux machines 
and I am in the process of trying to fix that as best as I can. Unfortunately I am less experienced with Linux machines
and the usage of java on them so this may take a while.

//TODO:
 - Add first sensor that communicates via MQTT from the FiPy board. Hopefully this will branch into LoRa however that will require more FiPy
	boards and antenna.
 - Purtify web interface - add functionality to the pages
 - Add info
 - Make more complex pages that allow for data analysis
